                <p>C++ (pronounced "C plus plus") is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by Danish 
                    computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". 
                    The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and 
                    functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented 
                    as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, 
                    Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.C++ was designed with systems
                    programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency,
                    and flexibility of use as its design highlights. <br> <br>C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts,
                    with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,
                    including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and 
                    performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</p>

                    <p>In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to 
                        C++.[19] The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming 
                        for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software 
                        development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable 
                        for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the 
                        UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance 
                        the C language with Simula-like features.[20] C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and 
                        widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, 
                        including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.</p>
